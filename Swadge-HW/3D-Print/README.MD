<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
<br />
The Hot Dog Shell 3D design team comprised of Erik Jacobs, Greg Lord, and Emily Anthony created two shell variants for Super 2025:

* A simplified model optimized for printing, open for customization and creative usage of infill for FDM printers
* A case with a living hinge, designed for injection molding out of PP

Injection Molded shells are only available at the Fangamer Merch Booth at Super 2025.

To print your own simple model:
 
Identify which type of printing technology you’d like to use to replicate your Shell. It’s sincerely not recommended to use the Injection Molding files for FDM printers, though you can try. It's likely the hinge will break.
<br />

### Materials

Materials required vary based on your printing method. It is recommended to print the FDM Shell with PETG or TPU, but really you can use any filament on hand.


### Assembly

FDM Fasteners:

Any M3 x 6mm self tapping screw
